<h2>About</h2>
First shell project for Operating Systems class CS3513. When run this project acts as a simple shell program.

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

This program is a basic shell for an OS. This shell is able to take in a user command as well as up to three arguments. The arguments are optional. Once the user command and potential arugments have been entered the program will search all paths for a matching command. If the command was entered properly and was found on one of the directories then the command as well as any arguments passed along with that command will be executed. The user may run as many commands as they would like, one at a time. Once the user is finished running commands and would like to exit, they may type "exit" in the terminal. Once "exit" has been typed the program will shut down. 
This program does not yet support the command cd or help. This functionality may be added later. 

<h2>Key learnings</h2>

- Learn to use and understand PATHS and parsing them into single directory names. 
- Understand the use of creating tokens with specific deliminators.
- Master the basics of an introductory shell program.
